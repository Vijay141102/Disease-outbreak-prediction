# Disease-outbreak-prediction
The Disease Outbreak Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application built using Streamlit to predict diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on user-inputted medical data. It leverages pre-trained models using Scikit-learn, with data processing handled by NumPy and Pandas. The app features a simple, interactive UI, allowing users to enter their health parameters and receive instant predictions. The project is easy to set up with a requirements.txt file and can be run locally using Streamlit.
